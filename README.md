# MAZE GENERATOR
**Welcome to Maze generator!!** It is a tool that helps you visualise how mazes are generated.

## Mazes
A maze is a complex structure of interconnected passageways. There should be (at least) one way to get from a designated start location to a designated end. Typically the path is convoluted and branched (these branches can also be branched, and often leading to dead-ends) making it not obvious to the naked eye the correct path to take (even when exposed to a Godâ€™s eye view from above with all information exposed).

## Algorithms Used

1. **Recursive Backtracker (Iterative version)** : This algorithm is a randomized version of the depth-first search algorithm. In this project it is implemented using a stack to simulate recursion. You can read more about this algorithm here : [Recursive Backtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
